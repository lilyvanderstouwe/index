<h1><center><font color=white>Have You Ever Wondered What It's Like in Outer Space?</center></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Outer space is the expanse that extends beyond Earth's atmosphere. There is not a definite point where our atmosphere ends and outer space begins, but the Karman line, at an altitude of 62 miles above sea level, is usually used as the dividing line.

<br>
<p>There is almost no gravity and no friction. This allows the moon, stars, and planets to travel freely on their orbits.</p>

<p><font color="white">Have you ever wondered why astronauts wear suits in space? Well, when you're up that high, the atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body. This causes fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. Yikes!<br><br>The drop in pressure also causes <b>ebullism,</b> which is a condition where gas bubbles form in the bodily fluids. This can cause the body to swell up to twice its normal size. The pressure inside the suit prevents this, as well as supplies oxygen to breathe.</p>
